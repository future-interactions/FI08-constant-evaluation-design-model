FI08: Constant Evaluation Design Model

The Office of Future Interactions design model informs everything we do. It is built around a concept we call Constant Evaluation and is supported by two complimentary modes of working — Inquiry and Speculation. With each mode acting as loose guide for a series of methods and processes. The model is open and we welcome suggestions and changes.
